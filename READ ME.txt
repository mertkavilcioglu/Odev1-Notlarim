This code is a horizontal character controller. If user wants to go right and presses "D", the character starts going to right
with 4.00 speed and to the right direction (not flipped) running animation, if user wants to go left and presses "A", the character starts going to left
with 4.00 speed and to the left (flipped) direction running animation. Also, if user doesn't press any button, the character stays at it's position with idle animation.
